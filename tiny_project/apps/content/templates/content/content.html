As mentioned elsewhere, but perhaps worth re-iterating. Nowhere have we told
UnCMS to render the page using this template.

If a ContentBase derivative has no urlconf provided, the UnCMS page view will
pick a sensible default template to render it with, and given that this is a
model called 'Content' in the 'content' app, it renders it with
`content/content.html`. The only thing we need to render this content object
is the current page and its content, so this simple default behaviour is good
enough.

  We have both pages.current (what it sounds like) and its content
  available in the template here as pages.current.content.
  {% endcomment %}

  <h1>{{ pages.current.title }}</h1>

  {% if pages.current.content.introduction %}
    <p>
      {{ pages.current.content.introduction|linebreaksbr }}
    </p>
  {% endif %}

  {# remember that ContentSection is FKed to `page`, not `Content` :) #}
  {% for section in pages.current.contentsection_set.all %}
    <section>
      <h2>{{ section.title }}</h2>

      {% if section.text %}
        {{ section.text|html}}
      {% endif %}
    </section>
  {% endfor %}
